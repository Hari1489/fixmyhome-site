Place the plumber image here:

- Save the image file as `plumber.png` in this folder.
- After placing the file, `fixmyhome_static_site.html` will use it automatically via `assets/plumber.png`.

If you want me to embed the image directly into the HTML as a base64 data URI, upload the image file or provide its URL and I will update the HTML for you.
